Issue:
VS Code not working on Ubuntu when connected using XRDP

Solution:
There are two files I changed which I don't know which is the correct one:
 libxcb.so.1
 libxcb.so.1.1.0

Here are the steps for the workaround:

1. Using (sudo su) nautilus, Search and found files on folder "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu"
2. Backup both files to a backup folder.
3. Then, execute the following command (sudo su):

 sudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1
 sudo sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1.1.0

1. Copy both files to "/usr/share/code"
2. In Windows, open Remote Desktop connection, assign Linux IP-Address.
3. In Linux Remote session, click on the Applications menu, go to Development, then Visual Studio Code and the application open.

Cleaner way:
# make a copy of the relevant library
mkdir ~/lib
cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libxcb.so.1 ~/lib
sed -i 's/BIG-REQUESTS/_IG-REQUESTS/' ~/lib/libxcb.so.1
# set the dynamic loader path to put your library first before executing VS Code
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/lib code
