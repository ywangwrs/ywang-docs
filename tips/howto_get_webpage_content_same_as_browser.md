# How to get WGET to download exact same web page html as browser

## Reference
https://askubuntu.com/questions/411540/how-to-get-wget-to-download-exact-same-web-page-html-as-browser

## Method
Some content of a page is generated by javascript, since wget doesn't support javascript, it just dumps the page as received from the server (ie before any javascript code runs) and so the table is missing.

We need a headless browser that supports javascript like **phantomjs**:

>  $ phantomjs save_page.js http://example.com > page.html

with save_page.js

```javascript
var system = require('system');
var page = require('webpage').create();

page.open(system.args[1], function()
{
    console.log(page.content);
    phantom.exit();
});
```

Then if you just want to extract some text, easiest might be to render the page with **w3m**:

>  $ w3m -dump page.html

and/or modify the phantomjs script to just dump what you're interested in.
